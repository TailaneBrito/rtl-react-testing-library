1. Create react-testing folder with "yarn create react-app react-testing --template typescript"
2 use `npm start` (to start the react-app) 
  use `yarn build` to create the production build


3. convention for test naming
  1 - write a failing test
  2 - make the test pass 
  3 - refactor 

4. The ??  operator only recognizes null  and undefined
`text ? text : '...'`  could be simplified `with text ?? ...`
